# Quantum Algorithm

`In quantum things are not dealt with bit, rather they are dealts with qubits`
`This is rather a new concept but slowly and steadly the quantum computers are the future billion dollar industry`
`There are many functions for which quantum algorithm proved to be better and quantum computing is required for that thing`

`A quantum bit, or qubit, is a unit vector in a two dimensional complex vector space for which a particular basis has been fixed and is denoted by:​`

`{|0›, |1›}`

`Qubits can be in a superposition of |0› and |1› such as` ​

`a|0› +b |1›`

`where a and b are complex numbers such that |a|2 + |b|2 = 1.`

## Quantum Mechanics in a Nutshell ​

> Superposition Postulate

- `State vector in Hilbert space, Tensor analysis`

> Measurement & Collapse Postulates

- `Projections, Inner-products etc​`

> Evolution Postulate

- `Schrodinger Equation,  Unitary Transformations etc.​`

## No-Cloning Theorem​

`The no cloning theorem is a result of quantum mechanics which forbids the creation of identical copies of an arbitrary unknown quantum state`

## Quantum Entanglement

`The phenomenon whereby a pair of particles are generated in such a way that the individual quantum states of each are indefinite until measured, and the act of measuring one determines the result of measuring the other, even when at a distance from each other`

`the phenomenon whereby a pair of particles are generated in such a way that the individual quantum states of each are indefinite until measured, and the act of measuring one determines the result of measuring the other, even when at a distance from each other`

## Quantum Teleportation​

`Quantum teleportation involves two distant, entangled particles in which the state of a third particle instantly "teleports" its state to the two entangled particles. Quantum teleportation is an important means for transmitting information in quantum computing.`

`Does not contradict no-cloning theorem`
