divide and conquer algorithm.
    The divide-and-conquer strategy solves a problem by:
1. Breaking it into subproblems that are themselves smaller instances of the same type of
problem
2. Recursively solving these subproblems
3. Appropriately combining their answers

Binary search
The ultimate divide-and-conquer algorithm is, of course, binary search: to find a key k in a
large file containing keys z[0, 1, . . . , n − 1] in sorted order, we first compare k with z[n/2], and
depending on the result we recurse either on the first half of the file, z[0, . . . , n/2 − 1], or on
the second half, z[n/2, . . . , n − 1]. The recurrence now is T (n) = T (dn/2e) + O(1), which is the
case a = 1, b = 2, d = 0. Plugging into our master theorem we get the familiar solution: a
running time of just O(log n).

Problem statement:- product of two d degree polynomial.

First fourier transformation algorithm for dlog(d) complexity.
This will require the use of complex number to compute.
Such that the evalutaion matrix exactly matches the fourier tramsformation.
So we will to nearest exact power of 2.
One of the most popular algorithm in the world

Week 3 , Lecture 2 :-

Greedy Algorithms.
    Sometime it's better to simply making moves which ever seems better. and not worrying too much about future consequences.
    Greedy algorithm builds up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next piece that offers the most obvious and immediate benefit.
    Minimum spanning tree is one such example.

Minimum spanning tree.

    Kruskal's algorithm.

    Property 1: Removing a cycle edge cannot disconnect a graph.
    
    Kruskal’s minimum spanning tree algorithm starts with the empty graph and then selects edges from E according to the following rule.
    "Repeatedly add the next lightest edge that doesn’t produce a cycle."

    Trees
        A tree is an undirected graph that is connected and acyclic. Much of what makes trees so useful is the simplicity of their structure. For instance,
    
    Property 2 A tree on n nodes has n − 1 edges.

    Property 3 Any connected, undirected graph G = (V, E) with |E| = |V | − 1 is a tree.

    Property 4 An undirected graph is a tree if and only if there is a unique path between any
    pair of nodes.  

Graph theory :-
    Human brain learn on its own, just given enough example.
    Grow at your own pace, style and time
    if you want to be pretty good in algorithm, then you have to work really hard on this course and algorithm.

The cut property.
    Cut property Suppose edges X are part of a minimum spanning tree of G = (V, E) . Pick any
    subset of nodes S for which X does not cross between S and V.

self discovery algorithm.
Properties of rank.

    Property 1 For any x , rank (x) < rank (π(x)) .

    Property 2 Any root node of rank k has at least 2 k nodes in its tree.

    Property 3 If there are n elements overall, there can be at most n/2 k nodes of rank k .
