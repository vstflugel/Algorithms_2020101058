Week 3 , Lecture 1:-

divide and conquer algorithm.
Problem statement:- product of two d degree polynomial.

First fourier transformation algorithm for dlog(d) complexity.
This will require the use of complex number to compute.
Such that the evalutaion matrix exactly matches the fourier tramsformation.
So we will to nearest exact power of 2.
One of the most popular algorithm in the world

Analysis.

Week 3 , Lecture 2 :-
