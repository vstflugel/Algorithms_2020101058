# PRIMALITY TESTINGâ€‹

- `A primality test is an algorithm for determining whether an input number is prime. Among other fields of mathematics, it is used for cryptography. Unlike integer factorization, primality tests do not generally give prime factors, only stating whether the input number is prime or not`

- `Fermat's primality test is often used if a rapid method is needed for filtering, for example in the key generation phase of the RSA public key cryptographic algorithm`

- `For large integers, the most efficient primality tests are pro- babilistic. However, for integers with a small fixed number of bits the best tests in practice are deterministic. Currently the best known tests of this type involve 3 rounds of the Miller-Rabin test for 32-bit integers and 7 rounds for 64-bit integers`
