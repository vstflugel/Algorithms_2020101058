# Week 1, lecture 1 -

Language is the subset of finite length strings.
Membership query -> given input X, X belongs to the language.

### Countability & Computability
- To show there are problems that computers cannot solve  we say like – there are
uncountably many computational problems, however there only countably infinity
many computable programs.
- So, therefore there must exist atleast uncountably many problems for which there
are no computer programs which can solve them (pigeonhole principle)
- Countable sets have one to one onto (bijection function)
    F: N -> S is computable set.
- If there exist a computer program for a problem then we can say that definitely
a C-program for a problem will exist for the same. Every computer program in
any realizable computer can be simulated by C program in a computer.

- To show that total number of C program are countable -> Since C program are
stored as binary strings of 0s and 1s, so we show set of finite length bit strings {0, 1} is
countable, so the total number of C programs are countable. (infinite length
programs are not C programs)

- Total number of problems = total number of subsets of binary strings = P({0,1}*)
 -> (cardinality of power set) -> can be shown by cantor/s diagonalization proof
Since power set of all finite length strings = Language, which is uncountable. So total
number of problems is uncountable.
- Total number of C programs is countable. So, these exists several or infinitely many
problems for which we cannot have programs.

### Turing Machine function
- At any given configuration all we can do is which state we are in, what is written on
the tape, based on that what control state to move in, what to write on tape and
where to move left or right or stay there.
- C programs are Turing complete. No C programs exist implies** that no algorithms/machine exits.
