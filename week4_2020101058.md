Greedy algorithm.
Activity Selection Problem.
    -In this problem we are supposed to  be finding the maximum number of tasks which can be done in a given stipulated period of time.
    -In this we will use greedy algorithm and first of sort all the activites based on there finishing time and after that we will use greedy algorithm to find the task which can be done continuously and then we will arrive to the required answer.

Huffman Code problem.
    -It is a lossless data compression algorithm.
    -We assign variable length code to input characters, length of which depends on frequency of characters.
    -The variable-length codes assigned to input characters are prefix codes.
    HUFFMAN TREE
        -Create a leaf node for each unique character and build a min heap of all leaf nodes.
        - Extract two nodes with the minimum frequency from the min heap.
        -create a new identical node with frequency equal to the sum of the two nodes frequencies. Make the first extracted node as its left child and the other extracted node as its right child. add this node to the min heap.
        -Now, Repeat the step 2 and step 3 until the heap contains only one node, the remaining node is the root node and the tree is complete.
