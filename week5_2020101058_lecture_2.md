Dynamic Programming 
Dynamic programming is method to quickly solve large problems by first solving intermediate problems, then using these intermediate problems to solve the large problem.


Shortest and longest Path in DAGS 
    Shortest Path in DAG 
        The result of this algorithm will be an array of values where each value is the shortest path in the DAG
        from s to the vertex corresponding to that index in the array. To calculate the value in location i, this
        algorithm takes O(i) time. Summed over all locations in the array, the running time is O(n2).
        In general, we solve dynamic programs in the following two steps:
            1. Come up with a table.
            2. Move in the table so that we solve a problem whose required subproblems have all been solved already.

Longest increasing subsequence.
Greedy algorithm are based on greedy choice and optimum substructure.
Shortect path in directed acyclic graph.
Topological Sorting.
Hamultonion path are the longest path.
Hamultonion paths are also NP-Complete.
What is the meaning of NP-Complete?

Longest subsequence Problem
    So we can solve this problem of DAG by creating a Graph such that each of those node in which Ai < Aj
    and then solving this problem will give us a feasible solution.
    Deadlocks are another concern which should be carefully think of.


Dynamic programming is a must and should be mastered first.
most lasting learning is slow and that is with the help of self discovery and youtube and other video are faster learning but are not lasting learning. Rather you can go for peer learning.
