Dynamic Programming 
Shortest and longest Path in DAGS 
Longest increasing subsequence.
Greedy algorithm are based on greedy choice and optimum substructure.
Shortect path in directed acyclic graph.
Topological Sorting.
Hamultonion path are the longest path.
Hamultonion paths are also NP-Complete.
What is the meaning of NP-Complete?

Longest subsequence Problem
    So we can solve this problem of DAG by creating a Graph such that each of those node in which Ai < Aj
    and then solving this problem will give us a feasible solution.
    Deadlocks are another concern which should be carefully think of.
