There are multiple ways of posing a problem, so if we pose mutiple problems then it really becomes difficult in case of counting. There can be many ways of posing the same problem unless we deal with actually finding out the double counting, triple counting or even it becomes evry difficult in cases of multiple counting. 

We can characterize the decision of each problem by the subset of the set of all the possible inputs(say the subset, {0,1}*). Here the output is true or false.
Subset of strings is called language. Since every problem can be characterised by the subsets of input which give me 2 answers, so every problem can be characterised by the language.
Ex - Check if a no. is prime or not. - this is a computation problem as it can posed as a language as checking if a given input is prime or not is same as saying that does the input belong to the set of primes.

Hence we are saying, given an input X asking for the output, is same as asking if the given input belongs to the set of all input which will give output 1. If it is yes, answer is X, else no.We can treat the problem as membership query in the set.

So, a computation problem is a membership query in the language. 

### Axioms of Computation - 
1. It takes non-zero time to retrieve data from far-off locations - means information travels at finite speed. It implies that random access memory is allowed only for small memory. It is not allowed for large memory. If we have a large memory, then it cannot have random access. We can only have sequential access. This also means that machines are omnipresent as the machines aren't present everywhere. So, it has to retrieve data from far-off locations. That's why the information takes time to travel. 

2. Machines are not omscient - In the finite amount of space that is accessible in finite unit of time, you can only reveal finite amount of tape symbols. Due to noise of the environment, we aren't sure if we can see infinite symbols on tape. We can only see 2 letters together as a single letter. In a completely non-noise environment this axiom can actually be violated as we cannot retrieve 100% information. Since, we believe that the world is noisy, so we store fin
