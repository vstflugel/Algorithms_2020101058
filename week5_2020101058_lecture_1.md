Greedy Algorithm.
Set cover and approximation algorithms.

Greedy algorithm sometimes gives very beautiful solution whenever it holds true.

Greedy is indeed optimum but it is not always the case.which can be shown using various couner examples.

Greedy algorithm Ending.
Self analysis and discovery is homework.

Why Go Greedy?
Set cover is NP-complete.

proof of approximation.

O(ln n)- Approximate Greedy algorithm for the problem of minimum set cover.

SET COVER
Input: A set of elements B; sets S 1 , . . . , S m ⊆ B
Output: A selection of the S i whose union is B.
Cost: Number of sets picked.

The ratio between the greedy algorithm’s solution and the optimal solution varies from
input to input but is always less than ln n. And there are certain inputs for which the ratio is
very close to ln n . We call this maximum ratio the approximation factor of the
greedy algorithm. There seems to be a lot of room for improvement, but in fact such hopes are
unjustified: it turns out that under certain widely-held complexity assumptions
