Divide and conquer.
All these are faster algorithm and among these are also faster methods.

Master theorem.
in this method we start branching from top to end with some branching factor a.

Merge sort.
Split the list into equal halves.
Recursively sort each half.
Then merge the two sorted sub-lists.
This merge procedure does a constant amount of work per recursive call.
Thus merge is linear in n.

Iterative merge sort
Lower bound for comparison based sorting
merge sort is optimal.
We learnt how the optimal number of steps are there in merge sort.
We also learnt that the lower bount for comparison based sorting is O(nlogn)

Matrix Multiplication.
n^3 is the naive method 
but later using divide and conquer we can optimize it even further.
Strassen's algorithm.

Median Finding
The optimum solution can be solved in linear time.
How do we choose v:- 
Deterministic approach and randomised approach.
Order statistics.
