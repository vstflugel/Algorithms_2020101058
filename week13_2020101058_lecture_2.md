# EFFICIENT INTEGER FACTORIZATION USING QUANTUM COMPUTERS

## Shor’s Algorithm​

* FACTORING is reduced to finding a nontrivial square root of 1 modulo N.​
​
* Finding such a root is reduced to computing the order of a random integer modulo N.​

* The order of an integer is precisely the period of a particular periodic superposition.​​

* Finally, periods of superpositions can be efficiently found by the quantum FFT.​

## Quantum Mechanics​

* MASSIVE PARALLELISM

* Quantum Parallelism

* Setting Up the Periodic Superposition

* Fourier Transform of a Periodic Vector

* The FFT/DFT MATRIX​
