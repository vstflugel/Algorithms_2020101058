#FLOYD-WARSHALL Algorithm
   - This is similar to dijistra algorithm but the difference is that dijistra algorithm is single source where as in this we calculate for all the vertices.
   - In this problem we tend to first fill the matrix 0 with the immediate path value/cost which we get.
   - then  in the next step we fill the first matrix and in this we keep the intermediate point to be 1 and then find the shortest path and if the path is short we keep it otherwise we take it from the previous matrix.
   - and then we complete the matrix to end and resulting end matrix will be our final solution.
   - We can do this in O(n^3) time complexity.

#Independent Set in Trees
   -  A subset of nodes S of V is an independent set of graph G = (V,E) if there are no edges between them.â€‹
   - this can be done using dynamic programming via dividing the problem in two cases in which we will calculate the maximum of independent children of w and in the other the grand children of w  + 1 and then taking maximum of it and keep on doing it till we get the solution.
