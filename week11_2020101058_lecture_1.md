# NP-completeness Theory

- `A complete problem for a given complexity class C and reduction ≤ is a problem P that belongs to C, such that every problem A in C has a reduction A ≤ P.`

- `NP-complete languages are significant because all NP-complete languages are thought of having similar hardness, in that process solving one implies that others are solved as well. If some NP-complete languages are proven to be in P, then all of NPs are proven to be in P`

- `An example of an NP-hard problem is the decision subset sum problem: given a set of integers, does any non-empty subset of them add up to zero? That is a decision problem and happens to be NP-complete`

#  Vertex Cover problem:-

  - If G is an undirected graph, a vertex cover of G is a subset of the nodes.
  - Every edge of G touches one of those nodes.
  - This problem asks whether a graph contains a vertex cover of a specified size:
  - Vextex-Cover = { <G,k> | G is an undirected graph that has a k-node vertex cover}.
  - Claim:-
    - Vertex-cover is NP-complete.
  - Proof:
    - The solution for the problem is a subset V' of V, containing the vertices in the vertex cover.
    - If V' is a vertex cover of size k, it can be checked using the following strategy:
    ```
    count = 0;
    for each vertex v in V'
      remove all edges adjacent to v from set E
      count++;
      if count == k and E == NULL(empty)
      then 
        the given solution is correct
      else 
        the given solution is wrong
    ```
    - Since this can be done in polynomial time, there fore it belongs to NP class.
    - Next, it can be proved that the problem is NP hard.
    - Consider the clique problem, which is NP complete => NP hard also.
    - Consider the problem of finding out whether there is a clique of size k in the given graph.
    - An instance of the clique problem is a graph G (V, E) and a non-negative integer k.
    - To check:- Existence of a clique of size k in G.
    - Consider the graph G’ which consists of all edges not in G, but in the complete graph using all vertices in G.
    - Size of clique k in G
    - Set of vertices in the clique is V'.
    - In the complement graph G’, let us pick any edge (u, v). Then at least one of u or v must be in the set V – V’. 
    - This means that the edge (u, v) is in G which is not possible since (u, v) is not in G.
    - Thus, all edges in G’ are covered by vertices in the set V – V’.
    - Similarly, we can say this for V'' of size |V| - k in G'.
    - Thus, we can say that there is a clique of size k in graph G if and only if there is a vertex cover of size |V| – k in G’.
    - Any instance of the clique problem can be reduced to an instance of the vertex cover problem. 
    - Thus the vertex cover problem is in both NP and NP hard classes, and hence, NP complete.

- Subset Sum problem:
Given N non-negative integers a1,...,an and a target sum K, the task is to decide if there is a subset having a sum equal to K.
We can obtain a solution to this problem in polynomial time . This can be done by checking that the sum of the integers in subset S' is equal to K.
Is in NP-hard:
Carry out a reduction from which the Vertex Cover Problem can be reduced to the Subset Sum problem.
Assume a graph G(V, E) where V = {1, 2, …, N}.
If a set is "good", there exists subset B of A such that the sum of the elements in B is equal to s.
Length of B encoding is polynomial in length of A encoding.
Here exists a polynomial-time algorithm that verifies whether B is a set of numbers whose sum is s.
After solving, it turns out that the subset sum problem is present in both NP class and in NP hard class.
Therefore the subset sum problem is a NP complete problem.
