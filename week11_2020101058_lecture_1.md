# NP-completeness Theory

- `A complete problem for a given complexity class C and reduction ≤ is a problem P that belongs to C, such that every problem A in C has a reduction A ≤ P.`

- `NP-complete languages are significant because all NP-complete languages are thought of having similar hardness, in that process solving one implies that others are solved as well. If some NP-complete languages are proven to be in P, then all of NPs are proven to be in P`

- `An example of an NP-hard problem is the decision subset sum problem: given a set of integers, does any non-empty subset of them add up to zero? That is a decision problem and happens to be NP-complete`
